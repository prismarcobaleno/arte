The names "John Doe" for males, "Jane Doe" or "Jane Roe" for females, Version: 0

or "Jonnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or just "Doe" non-gen-

der-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party whose true Remark:

identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or discus-
sion. The names are also used to refer to acorpse or hospital patient

whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United

States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries

ean

including the United Kingdom itself, from where the use of "John Doe" in a
legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or John Smith are used in

the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.
